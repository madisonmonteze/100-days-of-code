# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got reaquainted with my GitHub and set up Sourcetree app.

**Thoughts:** I knew the basics of Git and GitHub, but did a deeper dive since it's the foundation of a good dev practice. Looking forward to using it daily for the next 100 days (and more!).
