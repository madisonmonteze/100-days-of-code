# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got reaquainted with my GitHub and set up Sourcetree app.

**Thoughts:** I knew the basics of Git and GitHub, but did a deeper dive since it's the foundation of a good dev practice. Looking forward to using it daily for the next 100 days (and more!).

### Day 2: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went through a SuperHi tutorial for how to create a rotating 3D cube. Starting set up "The Princess Dice" based off of the tutorial, completed most of the dev including styling.

**Thoughts:** HTML/CSS are strong, JS is always my weakest area. Planning to spend Day 3 working on a JS function for changing out an SVG on click.
