# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got reaquainted with my GitHub and set up Sourcetree app.

**Thoughts:** I knew the basics of Git and GitHub, but did a deeper dive since it's the foundation of a good dev practice. Looking forward to using it daily for the next 100 days (and more!).

### Day 2: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went through a SuperHi tutorial for how to create a rotating 3D cube. Starting set up "The Princess Dice" based off of the tutorial, completed most of the dev including styling.

**Thoughts:** HTML/CSS are strong, JS is always my weakest area. Planning to spend Day 3 working on a JS function for changing out an SVG on click.

### Day 3: April 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the 3D rotating cube / Princess Dice using CSS and JS.

**Thoughts:** Pretty happy with how the modal pop-up functionality turned out. Would like to play around with other ways of doing modals soon.

### Day 4: May 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to install Theme Kit for Shopify and integrate with GitHub for version control and terminal for local updates. 

**Thoughts:** Didn't mean to take a few days break, but felt good to finally get this set up figured out. Took me longer than I thought it would!
